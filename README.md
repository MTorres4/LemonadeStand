SOLID Design Principles: ‘Lemonade Stand’
	Within ‘Lemonade Stand’, multiple instances of SOLID Design principles are prevalent. Beginning with ‘S’, Single Responsibility Principle, each class is responsible for one thing 
	and it is meant to do that one thing well. For example, the store requires information to display to the user and for convenience, but is only responsible for items to be available 
	for purchase with a price. Another example of a method being responsible for one thing, is the ‘MakePitcher’ method. It is truly responsible for using the user input, recipe, and 
	mixing them together to create a pitcher of lemonade.

		Another example of SOLID Design principles being used my version of ‘Lemonade Stand’ is the Open/Closed Principle. I have designed my code to be able to buy additional items 
	from the store, adjust the probability for customers to purchase items from the stand, and other adjustments such as adding options for longer play time. This project has enabled me to 
	prepare my project in a certain way and needing to adjust when applicable. With the various parts needing to rely upon other parts within the same project allows me to see how using the 
	5 SOLID Design principles are crucial in making clear, concise, and accountable code.
